The project is built upon the lecturer's (Ian Bertram) results of the Solar System Simulation that we (the students) also made, and of which you can find my own solution in the Solar System Simulation project.

Alongside the documentation, in this folder you can find a Project Report made by me, detailing the working and benchmarking of the code.
