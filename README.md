This repository contains 3 Java projects (HTML used for documentation) I made during my undergraduate and masters studies in Theoretical Physics at Lancaster University. These are intended for presentation purposes only, but do feel free to use any if interested. 

The projects are, in chronological order:
 - **Solar system simulation**: this project is the most well documented and was assessed with an A+ in the programming course. 
 - **Shor's (and Grover's) quantum algorithm simulation**: the project was created as part of a quantum computing group project. It is not well documented, 
although its workings a bit described in the PDF therein. I slightly reinvent the wheel by implementing from scratch objects such as complex numbers and 
methods such as matrix multiplications. Nonetheless, it proved a good exercise. 
 - **Particle accelerator simulation**: this project is built on top of the solar system simulation project but this time including bodies which are accelerated 
in their rotation by magnetic fields which are spatially localised. This endeavour also resulted in an A for the code, although the documentation is not as
detailed as in the solar system counterpart. 


All projects contain a PDF report describing the working of the code and benchmarking it. The accelerator project also contain java docs,
which can be instantiated by going to the doc/ folders therein and opening allclasses-index.html.
